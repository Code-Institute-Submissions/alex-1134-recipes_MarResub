# Milestone Project 3: Backend Development (HTML5, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT, PYTHON, FLASK)

The aim of this project is to design and build a front- and back-end interactive site that will allow the user to add data to its database. The user should be able to engage with the data and add / edit / delete the data on the site.

## Cook Book
The application is a website with recipes where users, after creating an account and logging in, can add their own recipes to the website. They can also alter and / or delete their recipes. Any unlogged user has access to the recipes (read only).

You can view the deployed game [here]


## User Experience(UX)

    * ### User Stories

        1. First Time Visitors Goals:
        
            a. A First Time Visitor should be able to identify the purpose of the site by entering the main page which clearly states the purpose that it serves. If the visitor likes what they see, they can easily register (no email confirmation needed) and participate in the creating of the page by adding their own food ideas to it.

            b. A First Time Visitor should be able to easily navigate through the website's content. The menu is clearly separated from the rest of the content in both desktop and mobiles versions and the Search Bar is available as well.

        2. Returning / Frequent Visitor Goals: 

            a. A Returning Visitor (1) will come back for recipes if they find the meal ideas interesting.

            b. A Returning Visitor (2) will come back to participate in the creation and further growth of the application.

            c. A Returning Visitor (3) will come back for both options 1 and 2. 


* ### Design

    1. Color Scheme

        Warm colours are used to make sure that the user gets a "cosy", welcoming feeling visiting the website.
        The background picture presents vegetables only, a neutral kind of food which will encourage people on aall kinds of diets and does not make anyone feel exluded or discouraged (like, for example, vegans).


* ### Wireframes

* ### Mockups

## Features

## Code Testing

    All the code was tested for errors by the following code validators:

    * W3C
    * w3C CSS
    * JSHint

    You can see the test results below:


    There were some things missing 



## Browser Compatibility Testing
  
   * The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer and Firefox browsres.

   * It was also viewed on different devices such as PCs, mobile phones, different models of iPhones, tablets, iPads and laptops.

   * Hyperlinks were tested......................................

   * Family and friends added some recipes / reviewed the site to make sure the author did not miss any bugs or problems and that 
     the website is intuitive and easy to use / navigate through.



## Manual Testing

  In order to make sure that everything works fine on the website a series of tests was conducted:

   * Every picture in both games was clicked on to make sure it works
   * Every picture in both games was double-clicked on to make sure that id does not hide back
   * As many pictures as possible were quickly clicked on to make sure that no more than two photos could be visible at the same time
   * All hyperlinks were also checked

   All tests were passed.

### Existing Bugs

  

### Problems


## Deployment

  The website was deployed on Heroku. In order to do so, I logged into my GitHub account, found the repository (memory_game_milestone) and followed the deployment steps.

  In order to clone this project and run it locally: 
   * log into GitHub account (using Chrome) 
   * install Gitpod extensions for Chrome 
   * restart the browser
   * go to the project's repository
   * click on the green Gitpod button - this will open a new workspace that will enable to work on the code locally
