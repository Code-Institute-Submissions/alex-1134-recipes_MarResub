# Milestone Project 3: Backend Development (HTML5, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT, PYTHON, FLASK)

The aim of this project is to design and build a front- and back-end interactive site that will allow the user to add data to its database. The user should be able to engage with the data and add / edit / delete the data on the site.

## Cook Book
The application is a website with recipes where users, after creating an account and logging in, can add their own recipes to the website. They can also alter and / or delete their recipes. Any unlogged user has access to the recipes (read only).

## User Experience(UX)

    * ### User Stories

        1. First Time Visitors Goals:
        
            a. A First Time Visitor should be able to identify the purpose of the site by entering the main page which clearly states the purpose that it serves. If the visitor likes what they see, they can easily register (no email confirmation needed) and participate in the creating of the page by adding their own food ideas to it.

            b. A First Time Visitor should be able to easily navigate through the website's content. The menu is clearly separated from the rest of the content in both desktop and mobiles versions and the Search Bar is available as well.

        2. Returning / Frequent Visitor Goals: 

            a. A Returning Visitor (1) will come back for recipes if they find the meal ideas interesting.

            b. A Returning Visitor (2) will come back to participate in the creation and further growth of the application.

            c. A Returning Visitor (3) will come back for both options 1 and 2.
